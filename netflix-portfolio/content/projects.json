      "challenges": "Adapting software development methodologies (Agile) to the traditionally sequential construction industry presented conceptual and practical challenges. Analyzing diverse international case studies required reconciling different regulatory environments, cultural contexts, and project scales. Identifying barriers to Agile adoption including cultural resistance, training requirements, and integration with established Waterfall methodologies. Synthesizing empirical evidence with theoretical frameworks to produce actionable recommendations.",
      "solutions": "Developed comparative framework analyzing Agile implementation across three distinct construction projects in different countries. Synthesized existing literature with empirical case study data to identify patterns and best practices. Proposed hybrid Agile–Waterfall models that leverage strengths of both methodologies. Identified digital twin technology and modern collaboration tools as enablers for Agile adoption. Created actionable recommendations for construction firms considering Agile transformation, emphasizing change management, stakeholder buy-in, and iterative implementation strategies.",
